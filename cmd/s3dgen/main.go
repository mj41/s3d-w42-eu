// Command s3dgen writes the robot for the page: robot3d's parts at rest, each a named node under
// its joint, as a glTF binary (web/robot.glb).
//
// The nodes: robot (scale 0.001: glTF is in metres, robot3d in millimetres) → base (the plate)
// → yaw (turns about Y: the servo) → head (at robot3d.PitchPivot(), turns about X: the main
// body, the CoreS3, the LED bars, the screen). A part under head is translated by -pivot, so in
// its node every vertex is where robot3d has it at rest. The screen is a textured quad at
// robot3d.Screen() (its picture is drawn in robot3d's shader, not modelled).
